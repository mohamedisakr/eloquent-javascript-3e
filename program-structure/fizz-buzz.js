/**
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, 
with 2 exceptions. 
1. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and 
2. for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
3. When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz",
for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or
"Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed
out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved
it, youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
